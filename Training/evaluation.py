Evaluation - Medium Accuracy Precission (MAP)

Output Classification:
1) True Positive (Correct) = TP
2) False Positive (Wrongly identified) = FP
3) True Negative (Correct) = TN
4) False Negative (Wrongly identified) = FN

Once the model is trained, we will take a look at
1) Precision [formula: TP/(TP+FP)] - what proportion of the detections were correct (the higher the better)
2) Recall [formula: TP/(TP+FN)] - what proportion of the actual existing objects were captured in this image (higher)
3) Loss - Output vs Provided Data (lower-better)
