With yolo we can detect objects at a relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second
while with a CPU around a frame per second.

3 most used and known frameworks compatible with YOLO and the advantages and disadvantages of each one:



1) Darknet : it’s the framework built from the developer of YOLO and made specifically for yolo.

Advantage: it’s fast, it can work with GPU or CPU
Disadvantage: it only works with Linux os

2) Darkflow: it’s the adaptation of darknet to Tensorflow (another deep learning framework).

Advantage: it’s fast, it can work with GPU or CPU, and it’s also compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac.
Disadvantage: the installation it’s really complex, especially on windows

3) Opencv: also opencv has a deep learning framework that works with YOLO. Just make sure you have opencv 3.4.2 at least.

Advantage: it works without needing to install anything except opencv.
Disadvantage: it only works with CPU, so you can’t get really high speed to process videos in real time.
