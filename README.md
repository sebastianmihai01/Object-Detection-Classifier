# Documentation
## Steps:
 - Done with Tensorflow Object Recognition API
 - Leveraged Camera (Labelling and identifying the objects)
 - Training (Static & Dynamic-real time- Detection) is done via labelling
 - Data: Image ... Answers: Annotations/Labels ... Trained the ML model with these

#
## Algorithms & Approaches:
- MobileNet Convolutional NN model used\
