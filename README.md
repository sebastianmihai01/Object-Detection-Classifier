# Documentation
## Notes for creators:
 - Done with Tensorflow Object Recognition API
 - Leveraged Camera (Labelling and identifying the objects)
 - Training (Static & Dynamic-real time- Detection) is done via labelling
 - Data: Image ... Answers: Annotations/Labels ... Trained the ML model with these
 - Freeze (save&load) model
 - Export and Deploy (Reusable models) / Convert into 'tf' format
 - Perform tuning (solving wrongfully detected objects)
 - Training on Google Cloud (saves RAM)
 - TBT: Rasperry PI integration (coming in September)

#
## Algorithms & Approaches:
- MobileNet Convolutional NN model used\
